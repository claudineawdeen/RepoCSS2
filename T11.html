     <h1>piece by piece to mastery</h1>
     <p>Learning to code is like solving a puzzle. Each piece, whether it’s HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
        connect to build a complete picture. With consistent practice and curiosity, anyone can create
        something amazing. Start small, but dream big, and remember, every expert was once a
        beginner
    </p>
    <p>Coding is not just about writing lines of syntax; it’s about unlocking creativity and solving realworld problems. By understanding the building blocks of programming, you gain the power to
        turn ideas into reality. Stay persistent, embrace challenges, and celebrate each milestone as
        you grow into a confident and capable coder.
